### CODING PROTOCOL

Coding Instructions

- Write the minimum code required
- No sweeping changes
- No unrelated edits - focus on just the task you're on
- Make code precise, modular, testable
- Donâ€™t break existing functionality
- If I need to do anything tell me clearly
- If you have doubts about the task, ask me clearly
- Whenever you make a change, write it down in the ai_changes_log.md file with the date and time and file name and the change you made.
